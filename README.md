## ✨ Future Aspirations

1.  __Implementation of Libraries and Frameworks__
    - I am fascinated with tailwind and react. These will be used in future updates or other projects
2.  __Improvement of UIUX__
    - As this is my first time in front-end development, I am hoping to enhance user experience. Please give me feedbacks for better UIUX or fork the program.
3.  __Enhancing Github Management__
    - This is also my first time I use Github. If you can give me suggestions, feel free to contact me.
